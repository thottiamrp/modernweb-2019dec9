# Chapter 2: Debugging and Breakpoints

## Objectives
* Practice with the Chrome devtools debugger.

1. In VSCode, navigate to /Demos/Chapter02-Browsers/debug/debugging.html 

1. Open the code in Browser window: 
    * Right click to open dev tools
    * Choose Sources tab
    * click in the html file in the left menu (even though it is already highlighted in blue)

1. Scroll down to find line 13 and set a breakpoint by clicking on the number 13.

1. In the browser display - click the `Run Code` button, and notice execution stops on line 13. 

1. Adjust the devtools display so that you can see the current values of a and b. (There is a hide left menu button to the immediate left of the display of debugging.html)

1. Use the debugging menu, and step through the code, watching the values of a and b that are passed to a callback function

Is it clear how the Arrays.prototype.sort() function works when passed a function?
