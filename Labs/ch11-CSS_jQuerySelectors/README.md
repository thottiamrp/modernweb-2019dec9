### Estimated Completion Time

## Steps:

1. Continue working with your `WIP\jQuery\jq.html` file. If you were not able to finish the last exercise, you can copy the solution `\Labs\ch10-jQuerySelectors\solution\selectors.html` ovr your jq.html file. 

1. Apply multiple CSS styles to the `<ul>` elements to make the width narrower, and add a border.

	```javascript
	$("ul").css({
		width: 400,
		border: '2px dashed pink'
	});
	```
1. Refresh the browser to see the changes.

1. Make the items that you do not like to do have a red font.  You can use:
	``` javascript
		$("p:contains('DO NOT')").css('color','red');
	```
1. Refresh the browser to see the red text.

1. Make every other table row highlighted with grey. You can use:
	``` javascript
	$("tr:even").css('background-color','rgba(128,128,128,.5)');
	```



1. Add a `<style></style>` section in the head. Add a class called `highlight` which applies a yellow background.

1. Add a button before your list items with an id of `toggleli` and the text  `Toggle Events`. 

1. Use jQuery to add a click event for this button. In the callback function toggle the highlight class for even li's. 

1. Mark your work as complete.
