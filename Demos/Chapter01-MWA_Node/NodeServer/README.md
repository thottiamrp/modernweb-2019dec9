1. In the editor, view the contents of `serverExample.js`

1. Use node to run this example. `node serverExample`

1. Open a browser to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ and view the output. In VSCode you can use this link to open it. 

1. Change Hello World to Hello Universe. Refresh your brower, and notice you do not see the changes!
